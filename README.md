This is a face recognition program which use heuristic approach. It initially use PCA to reduce dimensions and than the projection is passed in lda algorithm.
28 students having rollno in syntax of '16BIT_ _ _' where last three digit are numbers were use to train this model. 181 photos were used for training and 21 for testing
Accuracy of approx 95 was obtained. To run this code download the database from the following link:- https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NjttxvgBbNwGoTo77sr5lTW1Xcp4HOVe
